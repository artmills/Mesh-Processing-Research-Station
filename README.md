# Renderer

A playground for mesh analysis algorithms. 
This will be forever in-progress as I constantly think of random new features to add. 
Code written from my old personal projects playing with shaders and from my projects taking OSU's CS 550/554/557.
Warning: not at all user-friendly! Is currently just for me to test the implementation of various algorithms and will require messing with the code.

Current available features:
* Import a mesh from a .ply file.
* Visualize mesh using per-fragment coloring.
* Loop subdivision.
* Various Laplacian-based smoothing schemes.
* Silhouette computation.
* Depth-peeling to detect depth of objects.
* Mouse-picking to select individual triangles on a mesh using GLM's raycasting algorithms.
